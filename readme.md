# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Set up Docker:

- Install Docker in your machine

- verify docker is ready by running the following commands in your terminal: `docker -v` and `docker-compose -v`

- test if the backend is running and able to connect to your local database by pointing your browser to http://localhost:3000/api/ping

- check the frontend and make sure itâ€™s connected to the backend by creating a new user on http://localhost:3001/register

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_
